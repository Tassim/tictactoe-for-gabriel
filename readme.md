# Tic Tac Toe for Gabriel

## Description
Very simple tic tac toe game (no AI logic) built for a 4-year-old boy that love this game to be entertained for little over 20 minutes haha and for me to remember how to build a simple application using only HTML, CSS and JS.
 
## Technologies

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Instructions
Run the HTML file in any browser

## Challenges

* After only creating files on React, it was fun to go through all this again.

## Directions for future Development

* Elaborate better AI, as Gabriel gets more advanced on the game

## Credits

Thank you Gabriel for inspiring me to practice my code (haha)
